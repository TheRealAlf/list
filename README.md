# XGDPS Demons List Guidelines & Information

Welcome to the Information and Guidelines page
This section of the website is made for any information about submitting records, the expectation for records, what you need to have for us to verify your list record as legitimate.


Note most, if not all of current guidelines and documentation are directly from Pointercrate.com we did not fully write this and yes we did use some of there writen guidelines to help write our guidelines.





## Currently you are entering Section A-1 (Submissions & Info)

Submitted records can correspond to a player completing a level or achieving progress above its minimum percentage requirement. The minimum requirement for a given list demon can be found in that level's page on the site. 

Players should submit their own records and include an uncut video of their progress or completion run. The video should be available on YouTube (We do not accept any other video-sharing platforms!)

Now lets talk about requirements for getting your record on the list.

#### Your list record must have the following
 
    - The video must have audible clicks, but if the clicks aren't not enough to prove the legitimacy of the record the list team will request Raw Footage with clicks.
    - For 100% records that do not show the in-game endscreen will not be eligible for the list, unless the game crashes before the endscreen is displayed. Records with endscreens that are unreadable for any reason will also not be accepted to the list.
    - The run for any record must start at the beginning of the level and last until the level submittable percentage.
    - Raw Footage is required for all records without clicks and is stronly encouraged for a users first submission to the list to have Raw Footage. 

##### What do we mean by Raw Footage?

    - Raw footage is defined as the unedited recording of the session, either from a recording software or a livestream.

##### What do we mean by Audible Clicks?
    
    - Mouse/Keyboard clicks that are loud enough for us to hear and verify there legitimacy

##### What if I have Raw Footage but No Clicks?

    - For records without audible clicks, it is strongly recommended to include raw footage with a handcam or liveplay of the session. Failure to follow this guideline significantly increases the likelihood of a rejected record due to high suspicion. 
    - More specifically, due to the ability of players to fake raw footage without clicks, any record without clicks that also does not include a handcam or livestream (not to be confused with a liveplay) has a very high likelihood of getting rejected. Please note, however, that a player will not be banned from the list unless conclusive evidence for hacking is discovered.
    - This guideline also applies to records with clicks that are barely audible to the viewer.

##### What are Liveplays?

    - Liveplays Similarly, raw footage may include a "liveplay", in which an external camera records the computer screen for the entire session. Liveplays will be considered only if the input device is visible during the majority of the recording; without this restriction, the player could just externally record a hacked video. Similarly to a handcam, including a liveplay as raw footage will also support the legitimacy of a record.

##### Can I send footage with a handcam?

    - Although the list team will never require it, raw footage may also contain a handcam. A handcam for this purpose is defined as a clear, continuous view of the player’s input device (e.g. a mouse) during the majority of the session. Raw footage with a handcam will greatly support the player’s legitimacy because they are considerably difficult to fake in a hacked record.






### Currently you are entering Section A-2 (Framerate & Modifications)

    - The FPS Bypass is a tool that allows the player to change framerates to play at any FPS and gave give certain advantages to the player such as being able to mimic 144hz ship control & more. Although not bannable it is allowed aslong as the framerate remains at or below **480FPS**. Any record with a higher framerate will be considered hacked and if the user lies about have the fps at or below 480FPS the user will be **banned from submitting a record for 2 months** 

    - Although the list team allows certain hacks for records on the list, a player may not submit a record obtained using hacks designed to alter or bypass the gameplay in any way. This guideline includes but is not limited to Noclip, GDBot/XBot/YBot/ZBot/DDHorbot, Macros, and Speedhacks. See below for allowed hacks.
    
    -The following list details the hacks (from the "Mega Hack") that we allow for records submitted to the list. Players should assume that any hack that is not on this list is not allowed. If you believe that something should be added this list, feel free to contact us through our Discord server!

    - FPS Bypass (up to 480FPS)
    - Accurate Percentage Hack
    - 4GB Patch
    - Editor Hack (for fixing approved bugs only, not LDMs)

### Currently you are entering Section B-1 (Level Updates & LDMS)

    - Along with patched skips, a level may be updated to include a strong LDM or "Ultra" LDM that would not normally be accepted. Records that were rejected for a strong LDM before such an update will be re-considered for addition to the list in accordance to the new LDM on the rated level.

    - If you are using a custom made LDM to submit a record for any level please send the list staff a copy of your LDM to evaluate if its allowed or not.  

    - If a level gets a buffdate of any sorts please note that all record from the level will be removed! Another thing to note is if creators end up buffing a level and hack verify it all record will be kept until the levels creator reverts or the XGDPS staff update the level back to its original form.


 




   
### Currently you are entering Section B-2 (Loopholes & Guideline Updates)

    - Although these guidelines aim to cover a wide variety of aspects to the Demon List, these rules are not necessarily exhaustive and may require re-wording in the future. Any player that attempts to evade these guidelines via a loophole in the wording of any given rule will be subject to the same punishment as if that rule was broken.

    - Over time, we are likely to add new guidelines detailing the criteria that a record must meet to qualify for the list. However, some records may not fit the current submission guidelines because they were still acceptable at the time of submission. However, the list team will almost never retroactively reject old records following a guidelines update, because it would not be fair to the record holders who followed the guidelines in place at the time.
